# Usage

How to use this template to create a minimal blog, powered by [`sveltekit`](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction).

## Cloning the repo

Clone this repo using the following command.

```bash
# clone this repo in the current directory
git clone https://github.com/ankur700/phos-template-markdown

# cd into the newly create project
cd phos-template-markdown
```

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
